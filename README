This is a hacked version of https://code.google.com/p/lightweight-java-profiler/ that 
allows you to control when profiling starts in a crude way which requires recompiling.

The constraints of JNI and the nature of the code make it difficult to modify the code
to have a simple control mechanism so what is here is very much just a hack to 
make the profiler useful for my needs.

The make file has been modified so all you need to do now is `make` - BITS=64 is not
needed

To change the delay before profiling starts modify delayed_start_profiler
